#Barely.Operation.Tiny-robot Walker

#Description

 This game was developed for the Portland Indie Game Sqaud's Summer Slow Jams!  The technical theme for this jam was Gadgets, and the creative theme was "unconventional Pets".   My initial idea was to use create a turnbased RPG that the player's robot uses energy to fight other robots, and that the player would walk to restore their energy.  To make this into a reality I developed the game for iOS just because it would be the easiest way to make a pedometer for the only device I had constant access to. My iPhone.
